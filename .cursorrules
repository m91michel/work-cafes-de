## Project description
This project is a website that lists the best cafes for working. 
- I add new cafes daily and I use google reviews to rate the cafes. The cafes are listed if people mention that they are good for working. 
- Cafe owners can add their cafe to the list by contacting me. If someone wants to remove their cafe they can use the report button. 
- This is a side project of Mathias Michel.

## CSV files
- format numbers with out commas (e.g. 1.000.000 -> 1000000)
- Use , as decimal separator
- Use "quotes" for long text with commas (e.g. "this is a long text, with a comma")

## Domains
- English: awifi.place
- German: cafezumarbeiten.de

## Additional instructions
- This project is a npm workspace. Use `-W` to install dependencies.
- For translations, use the `useCTranslation` hook if the file has a "use client" directive.
- Use `initTranslations` for translations in server components.
