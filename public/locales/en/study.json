    "how-long-can-stay.answer": "In most student-friendly cafes, you can stay for several hours, especially during off-peak times. A good rule of thumb: order something new every 2-3 hours and be especially mindful during lunch hours or weekends when the cafe gets busy.",

    "best-study-times.answer": "It's usually quietest in the morning (10 AM - 12 PM) and early afternoon (2 PM - 5 PM). Avoid lunch rush (12 PM - 2 PM) and weekend mornings - that's when it gets loud and crowded. Evenings after 7 PM usually quiet down again."
