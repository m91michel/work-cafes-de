## Problem Description
Its not so easy to find a place for working in Google Maps as it does not provide filters for laptop-friendly places. This means you have to check every single place manually and check for reviews, images and ratings.

## Solution
We use google review to evaluate if a cafe is laptop-friendly. A cafe is accepted only if at least 1 google review mention that it it offers a wifi connection. If at least one review mentions that the coffee owner does not allow working, we reject the cafe. A coffee owner can also contact us to remove their cafe from the directory.

## Challenges and ideas

- Improve Google ranking: I gained some traction, but I lost positions for the German version
- Add more information, such as features or vegan options
- Gather reviews from other sources, like TripAdvisor
- Allow users to add a review to remove the dependency on Google reviews
