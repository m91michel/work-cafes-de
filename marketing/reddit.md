## FRAGE
Ich bin baue gerade eine Seite mit den besten Cafes zum Arbeiten auf und daher w√ºrde mich gerne interessieren, was die besten Cafes in Frankfurt sind.
Wichtige Voraussetzung ist nat√ºrlich, dass es beim jeweiligen Cafe erlaubt ist, seinen Laptop aufschlagen und dass WLAN vorhanden ist. 
Was sind die besten Caf√©s in Frankfurt, die ihr empfehlen k√∂nnt?

Hey SideHustlers,

In this post, I just want to share how I use AI to generate images for my city pages. My idea was actually to use AI-generated images as temporary images until I replace them with real photos. But now I'm starting to like them. What is cool is that they are generated with just one generation, so I do not have to generate multiple images and select the best one.

Here are the details:

- I asked ChatGPT to generate a prompt for the image model.
- This gpt-4o-mini prompt was then used to generate the (image) prompt.
- The image prompt was then used to generate the image with recraft-ai/recraft-v3 model.
- Services: OpenAI and Replicate

Why did I actually want to use them temporarily?
If you look a bit closer, you will notice that the images are not perfect. You notice a landmark of the city, but the placement is wrong. For example, Hyderabad. But images like Singapore are perfect.

What do you think about the images?

Here is the site if you want to take a look: https://awifi.place

PS: I added a lot more cities if you have seen my last post.

## post for r/mexicocity

Hey, I am currently building a website with the best cafes in Mexico City.

My approach is to check google reviews for each cafe and filter for specific keywords like "work friendly" and "wifi" to filter out the best cafes in a city. With this approach I discovered 37 cafes in Mexico City.

With this post I want to gather feedback on the approach and if you have any other ideas on how to improve the website.

Hey digital nomads! üëã

I've created a free directory website that helps you find the best work-friendly cafes worldwide: https://awifi.place

How it works:
- Cafes are carefully selected based on Google reviews mentioning "work friendly" and "wifi"
- Each cafe is verified through review analysis to confirm wifi availability and work-friendliness
- Real review quotes about wifi speed and working conditions are displayed

What makes this different:
- 100% free to use
- Ethical approach: cafe owners can remove their listing anytime
- Focus on responsible co-working (we encourage supporting the cafes by purchasing and respecting other guests)
- Detailed info about wifi quality and work-specific features

While there are similar websites out there, I built this because I was still struggling to find good spots while traveling. The goal is to grow this into a community where users can review cafes specifically for their work-friendliness, and potentially expand to include co-working spaces too.

I'd love your feedback! There are still many cities to add, and I want to make sure this actually solves a real problem for fellow digital nomads. What features would you find most useful?

Show HN: A directory of work-friendly cafes powered by Google Reviews analysis

I built awifi.place to solve the problem of finding cafes where working is actually allowed. Instead of manual curation, it uses Google Reviews analysis to identify suitable places.

How it works:
- Analyzes Google Reviews for keywords like "work-friendly" and "wifi"
- Automatically excludes cafes where reviews mention working is not allowed
- Extracts and displays relevant review quotes about wifi quality and working conditions
- Cafe owners can opt-out anytime (ethical consideration)

Technical stack:
- Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- Supabase for database
- Google Maps Location API for address/hours and outscraper for reviews
- OpenAI for generating descriptions
- AI-generated city illustrations (using recraft-ai/recraft-v3)

Currently covering multiple cities worldwide, but I am looking for feedback on the approach and suggestions for additional features before I continue with the next city as its quite pricey to retrieve the reviews.
