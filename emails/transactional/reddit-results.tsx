Specifically higher end coffee machines.\n\nI'm from Singapore and noticed that some machines made in Germany might be cheaper there, especially second hand. Back home, machines like ECM, Profitec, and stuff are super expensive. Thought maybe it'd be a good chance to snag one while I'm there.\n\nAny locals or people who've bought second hand in Munich before? Are there sites like Craigslist, or apps people use? Or maybe even physical stores? I'd love to hear any advice!\n\nAlso, any tips on what to look out for when buying second hand? Not super experienced with machines beyond the entry-level ones, but I'd love to upgrade if I can find a good deal.\n\nAppreciate any help. Thanks!!",
